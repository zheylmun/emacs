#+title: Zach Heylmun Emacs Configuration

* Overview

This repo contains a custom git configuration created by [[https://github.com/zheylmun][Zach Heylmun]] based heavily on the excellent [[https://github.com/daviwil/emacs-from-scratch][Emacs From Scratch]] repository and [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEoMzSkcN8oPH1au7H6B7bBJ4ZO7BXjSZ][video series]] by [[https://github.com/daviwil][David Wilson]]. It contains a very small [[./init.el][init.el]] which simply disables some UI elements, bootstraps package management, and loads the real configuration contained in [[./config.org][config.org]].

* Installation

This is a self boot-strapping configuration.  To use it simply clone this repo to the home directory, then start Emacs.

#+begin_src sh

  git clone git@github.com:zheylmun/emacs.git ~/.emacs.d

#+end_src
